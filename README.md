Domain-Driven Design (DDD) 

1. Entities (entities/)
Purpose: Represent the core business objects with a distinct identity that persists over time.
Example: In a User domain, an entity could be User with attributes like id, name, and email.
2. Value Objects (valueObjects/)
Purpose: Represent domain concepts that are defined only by their attributes and do not have a distinct identity. They are immutable.
Example: In the Order domain, a value object might be Address or Money, which encapsulates currency and amount.
3. Services (services/)
Purpose: Contain business logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object. They orchestrate domain operations and interact with repositories.
Example: In the Order domain, a service might be OrderService that handles order processing.
4. Repositories (repositories/)
Purpose: Abstract the data access layer and provide methods to retrieve and persist entities.
Example: UserRepository or OrderRepository that interacts with the database or other storage mechanisms.
5. DAOs (daos/)
Purpose: Handle direct data access, often using SQL or an ORM. They are lower-level compared to repositories.
Example: UserDao or OrderDao that performs raw database operations.
6. Validators (validators/)
Purpose: Validate inputs and business rules before they reach the core logic or database. They ensure data integrity and correctness.
Example: UserValidator or OrderValidator that checks for valid data before processing.
7. Controllers (controllers/)
Purpose: Handle HTTP requests, delegate tasks to services, and send responses back to clients.
Example: UserController or OrderController that maps HTTP routes to service methods.
8. Routes (routes/)
Purpose: Define the API endpoints and associate them with controller methods.
Example: userRoutes or orderRoutes that map URL paths to the appropriate controllers.


Key Points:
Encapsulation: Each domain encapsulates its own logic and data, keeping it self-contained and modular.
Inter-Domain Communication: Domains can interact with each other if needed, often through well-defined interfaces or services.
Bounded Contexts: Domains are bounded contexts that represent distinct business areas, with their own models and logic.
This structure promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to manage, test, and evolve your application as it grows. Each domain can evolve independently while maintaining a clear boundary and responsibility.# palendar-mobile-server
